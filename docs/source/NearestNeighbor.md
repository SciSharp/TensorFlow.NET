# Chapter. Nearest Neighbor

The nearest neighbour algorithm was one of the first algorithms used to solve the travelling salesman problem. In it, the salesman starts at a random city and repeatedly visits the nearest city until all have been visited. It quickly yields a short tour, but usually not the optimal one.

The full example is [here](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET-Examples/blob/master/src/TensorFlowNET.Examples/BasicModels/NearestNeighbor.cs).
